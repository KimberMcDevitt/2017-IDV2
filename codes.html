           <p>Codes are marks or characters that are used to represent an object, mathematical process, element, musical note, and many more ideas.
           Codes are a tool of communication that can represent a complex meaning in a simple concept of a letter or combination of letters, a figure
           or other character or mark.  Codes symbolize the content of the message or idea with brevity and at times secrecy.</p>
           <p>  Braille is a type of code in that Braille uses a series of raised dots that can be felt and interpreted by anyone but is mainly used by
           those who are blind or have low vision.  The person learning Braille must understand the position of the raised dots to be able to interpret
           the meaning of the letter, word or symbol.  The position of these dots make the code. After the basic letters, numbers, common words, and punctuation are learned. The reader can connect the Braille cells together to form
           sentances and ideas.</p>
