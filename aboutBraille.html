           <p>According to the American Foundation for the Blind,"Braille is defined as a system of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by people who are blind or have low vision."
              Braille is a code that can be used by many languages such as English, Spanish, Chinese and many others.  It contains symbols and shortcuts to ease the interpretation of the raised dots.</p>
           <p>Braille was created by Louis Braille in the early 1800's in France.  Louis Braille was motivated by his love of reading and did not have access to 
             enough books.  The limitations were due producing books with raised print that was then read with the fingertips. This method was difficult to
             produce and resulted in lengthy and difficult to read books.  Louis Braille was fifteen when he invented this writing system and opened up a world of information to all with low vision or who are blind.  </p>
