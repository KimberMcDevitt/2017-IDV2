        <div class="story">
           <p>Shirley Confino-Rehder states that it is our responsiblity to provide artistic experiences for all people, including those with low vision.
             The fact that the artistic experience for blind people is felt through the fingertips instead of the eyes requires a tactitle medium to communicate the 
             spatial art.  
          
           <p>The Paul Klee museum in Bern, Switzerland offers visually impared museum patrons an opportunity to participate with the art by providing feel-good reliefs of ceratin exhibitions.
           This is a technique used to describe the painting description in Braille and includes a tactile formation of that same painting.  This type of display provides vision impared patrions with the ability to paricipate fully in the art experience.</p>
